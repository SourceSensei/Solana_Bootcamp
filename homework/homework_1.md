# Decentralized Monopoly

In a decentralized version of Monopoly with no central server, several key considerations come into play:

- The core game logic, including player turns, property transactions, and events, needs to be decentralized and agreed upon by all players.
- Players need a way to interact with each other directly without relying on a central authority.
-  Ownership of properties and assets should be recorded on a decentralized ledger or blockchain.
-  Preventing players from "double-spending" their assets (e.g., paying for properties with the same money multiple times) is crucial. This can be achieved through blockchain consensus mechanisms.
-  Transparency and fairness mechanisms on the blockchain can help to prevent cheating.
-  Ensuring that players are who they claim to be is challenging in a decentralized setting. Digital identities or reputation systems could help.
-  Implementing game rules as smart contracts on a blockchain ensures that rules are followed automatically and transparently.
-  The ledger should be immutable, preventing retroactive changes to game history.
  

# CBDCs and Decentralization

Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) represent a move towards digitizing traditional fiat currencies. However, they are issued and controlled by central authorities, which is in contrast to the decentralization principles of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
CBDCs can bring more people into the digital currency space, as they are issued by trusted institutions and have legal tender status. This could increase general awareness and trust in digital currencies.
Also, by being centralized, they might compete with decentralized cryptocurrencies. Some may argue that they could stifle innovation and limit financial freedom.
